# CSE 185 Lab Notebook - Week 5

terminology clairfication- 
sample=individuals marker=SNP=variant
phenotype=trait 
cohort- set of samples

Today-perform a GWAS for samples with blue vs brown eyes. 
Thursday- implement a program to predict eye color from a handful of SNOs

Setting up
``[cs185scu@ieng6-700]:week4:508$ git clone https://github.com/cse185-sp18/cse185-week5-helenistheking.git week5``

__Intro to the plink__
GWAS- genome wide assisted study. use a SNP genotype array and cleaned the dataset to remove dplicates ad problematic makrers. 
use plink to- operations on genetic datasets. type of files used by plink. 
use --file as an arguement, if binary use --bfile
.ped contains all the genotype information
.map SNP/variant info 
.fam




How many samples are in our cohort?
wc lab5_gwas_eyecolor.ped
      261 
      the number of samples
      
What is the frequency of brown vs. blue eyes in our samples?
`cat lab5_gwas_eyecolor.phen | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c
    104 1
    157 2`
    
How many SNPs are included in our dataset? Record the commands you used to determine this in your lab notebook. Note the results in the methods section of your lab report.
`wc lab5_gwas_eyecolor.map

  ___1. Analysing population structure__
  It turns out our sample was collected from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds. As we will learn in class on Wednesday, using a heterogenous sample may introduce spurious signals in our GWAS. We'd like to control for population structure in our cohort. For this, we'll use something called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA looks for groups of features (in this case, SNPs) that explain the most variation in our data. You can think of it as clustering our samples based on their ancestry._
  
  `plink --file /home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/public/week5/lab5_gwas_eyecolor --pca 10 --out lab5_pca_eyecolor`
  
  output file 
  make a scatter plot PC1 vs. PC2.
  
___2. Performing a basic GWAS___

using the genotype to make the observed and expected allele counts. use the observed vs expected allele counts to create a chi squared test. this forms pvalues to test the null hypothesis.

to do odds ratio then you have to work out the relative amount of cases vs controls. extend that compariosn between the two alleles in the controls and the cases to every possible SNP independently

      cat lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic | awk '($5=="ADD" || $0~/CHR/)' > lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic.no_covars

to find 
`week5:504$ awk '{ if($9 <= (5*10e-8)) { print }}' lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic.no_covars       
  15                                        rs1470608   28288121    1        ADD      261     0.1111       -5.512    3.557e-08

  15                                        rs1129038   28356859    1        ADD      261    0.01011       -7.306    2.749e-13

   using the --covars removes the the covariates specific lines from the output results
   pulling out the the significant SNPs
   
   
   
week5:520$ awk '{ if($9 <= (5*10e-8)) { print }}' lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic.no_covars | wc
     15
     
     so 15 passed the genome wide significance test. 
     
     (11 rows for each of the _var.assoc.logistic)
     
 week5:522$ awk '{ if($9 <= (5*10e-8)) { print }}' lab5_gwas_phen.assoc.logistic | wc
     32 

the pvalue means the probability of obstaining a result at least as extreme as what we observed given that the null hypothesis is true. 
bonferroni correlaion- adjust pvalue threshold by number of tests to correct for multiple hypotheseses. perform 1 test for each SNP but many are correlate with each other. suggested for genome wide sig is less than 5*10^-8. 


3. Visualizing GWAS results
must use assocplots python package for this
generate QQ plots and manhattan plots for the two GWAS (one with and with without covariates)

QQ PLOTS  two distrubutions roughly the same? x-expected values 
y-observed values
manhattan plots are x axis- position along the chromosomes and y is the long 10 value- so significantly more significant
nearby SNPs are highly correlated creating a skyscrapper pattern due to linkage disequilibrium

`[cs185scu@ieng6-700]:week5:532$ python ./scripts/gwas_plotter.py lab5_gwas_phen.assoc.logistic plotGWAS`

`[cs185scu@ieng6-700]:week5:532$ python ./scripts/gwas_plotter.py lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic.no_covars plot2GWAS`

use no_covars gwas as has the closest linear relationship with the qq plo. "high rises" in the Manhattan plot. 

plink --file /home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/public/week5/gwas_eyecolor --clump lab5_gwas_phen_var.assoc.logistic.no_covars --clump-field P --clump-p1 0.0001 --clump-p2 0.01 --clump-r2 0.5 --clump-kb 250 --out high_rises

covariants diverse ethnic sample- the ethnicity that would effect the phenotype 
adding in the covariants to clump the similar ancestral data together

**UNIX TIP** use less as a way of opening the file

[cs185scu@ieng6-700]:week5:503$ less high_risers.clumped 

these SNPs might not be the same as the given list due to the pvalue
the only SNP that is the same is the first one

__5- eye color prediction model and data__
irisplex paper  two models for the two separate case control blue vs brown and the second is other vs brown taking into intercept term model, and the sum of the effect size of the model/SNP and the number of minor alleles in the individual genotype
then rearrange it to find the probabiliyy of the p blue and p other 
there is a table of 6 SNPs converted to hg19 coordinates

--this part of the lab going to be looking .vcf file with smaller set of samples independent from orginal GWAS
#gives header info
each row for single variant
ID columns corresponds to same dbSNP in table.

| chrom | start    | rsid       | Minor allele |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 15    | 28365618 | rs12913832 | A            |
| 15    | 28230318 | rs1800407  | T            |
| 14    | 92773663 | rs12896399 | G            |

use scp to move the .vcg.gz file
'scp /home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/public/week5/lab5_pred_eyecolor.vcf.gz cs185scu@ieng6.ucsd.edu:/home/linux/ieng6/cs185s/cs185scu/week5'

get a header row listing 
'bcftools query -l lab5_pred_eyecolor.vcf.gz | datamash transpose | awk '{print "ID\t"$0"\t"}' > lab5_pred_eyecolor.tab'
bcftools <- used to wrange VCF files to any format you like
-l flag use to simplify the list

extract the ID and sample genotypes for each SNP
'bcftools query -f "%ID\t[%TGT\t]\n" lab5_pred_eyecolor.vcf.gz | sed 's/|//g' >> lab5_pred_eyecolor.tab'
used to output the genotype info. -f how things are output %ID column [] output PER SAMPLE [%TGT\t] print the genotype of each sample

transpose
'cat lab5_pred_eyecolor.tab | datamash transpose > lab5_pred_eyecolor_transpose.tab'
datamash transpose will make rows to columns and columns to rows
so one sample per column

Note, these SNPs are sorted by genomic coordinate, so are not in the same order as the SNPs in the table above or in the example spreadsheet! You might want to use awk to rearrange the columns before moving forward.
awk '{print $1, $5, $4, $3, $6, $2, $7}' lab5_pred_eyecolor_transpose.tab > lab5_pred_eyecolor_sorted.tab

Which group is more likely to have blue eyes?CEU or northern european.
Does this match with what is known about eye color frequencies in those populations? (Note, not all of these samples has genotyopes, so don't worry if some data is missing). 
Add up to almost one in both data sets

__8. Variant interpretation__
that often the SNPs identified by GWAS are not themselves causal variants but might lie nearby truly causal mutations. 


EC
there is 3x2x2x1x1x1=12 possible ways to arrange the different genotypes of the child
The child is most likely to have blue eyes
blue- 0.540056947	other-0.1506096358   brown-0.3093334172
